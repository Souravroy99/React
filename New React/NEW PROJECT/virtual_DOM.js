// Virtual DOM is the exact copy of actual browser DOM

// Virtual DOM never updates the original DOM directly, it updates the actual DOM(partially) based on some algorithm.

// Reconciliation: React keeps the in-memory virtual representation of actual DOM and keep it synchronize with a batch update. This process is called RECONCILIATION.
